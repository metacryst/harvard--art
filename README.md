# harvard--art

art museum websites seem to be more interested in cataloguing than creating a gallery experience, so I figured i would try and create a better website for simple viewing pleasure. it displays a gallery of paintings from the Harvard Art Museum. each painting can be clicked to be seen at a much larger size, along with the title, artist, and medium used. 

I wanted to build something i would enjoy using, and i can attest that there's something immensely satisfying about looking at paintings on here. just pull it up in full screen and explore!


### technologies

it is constructed with HTML, CSS, and ReactJS. It uses React Router for page navigation.
